# Shopping Cart

## Description

This project was built just to practice Typescript. This is a CRA(create-react-app) application with react-query and FakeStore API. This project uses Sass for the styling(this wasn't a project with an UI/UX focus, it has the minimum amount of styling required in order to navigate the site)
